## Description
Streamability is a collaborative and responsive application made to display where an individual can stream their favorite TV shows and movies.
When a user searches for their desired title, they'll be met with information about the title itself, what services stream the title, shows that 
are similar to the searched title, and a watch queue. Streamability is your one-stop-shop for planning your perfect movie night.
