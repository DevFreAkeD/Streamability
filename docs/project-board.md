| 🏗          | Enhancement | Improving an existing feature | `enh` |
| 💡          | Investigate | A new feature or issue needs to be investigated. No final coding will be done with this ticket. Instead, this ticket should produce a number of other feature tickets that are subsequently worked on. | `inv` |

# Buckets

Each column in the project board is considered a "bucket". A full list of these buckets and information about them can be found in the table  below.

| Name           | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 📋 Todo        | Needs to be done and has not been started yet. This is where you should look if you would like to start on a new ticket.
| 📝 In Progress | Task is actively being worked on by a developer. Tickets in this bucket should be assigned to a specific developer. If you take a "Todo" task, assign yourself and move it to "In Progress". If you stop working on it, un-assign yourself and move it back to "Todo".
| 🔍 In review   | This task has a submitted Pull Request. The pull request is currently being looked at by the team.
| ✅ Done        | Completed ticket. Tickets will be moved here automatically when resolved. Do not put anything in this bucket manually. Everything here will be automatically archived after 14 days.
| ❌ Blocked     | Work can not be started until another specific ticket is complete. 
| 🕐 Backlog     | Nothing is blocking work from starting, but it is not a priority. This is also a good place to look if you would like to start on a new ticket.
