# Streamability
Made by: Leithen Crider, Kevin Fan, Benjamin Holt, Tyler Norman

## Description
Streamability is a collaborative and responsive application made to display where an individual can stream their favorite TV shows and movies.
When a user searches for their desired title, they'll be met with information about the title itself, what services stream the title, shows that 
are similar to the searched title, and a watch queue. Streamability is your one-stop-shop for planning your perfect movie night.

## Frameworks, Libraries & API's
* HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS

## IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ:
This app was created during a coding bootcamp course by students. As such, the application is an assigned project to showcase front end development skills. This project was made with no prior knowledge of back end technologies, and extra steps will need to be taken in order for this application to function properly. Please follow the below instructions before using the app.

# 1:
Before searching for a title, follow this link in a new tab in your browser: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
Once opened, you will see a page with text that looks like this:

# 2:
Click the button on the page that says 'Request temporary access to the demo server'. Once you do, the page will show a bold text message that says 'You currently have access to the demo server.'
You may now exit out of the https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo tab.

# 3:
The app should now fully function. Keep in mind that failing to follow the steps above will prevent the app from giving you title suggestions for similar titles.
Additionally, the steps followed above only give you temporary access to the similar title suggestion; this access tends to last for 1-2 days.
Therefore, it may be necessary to re-perform the above steps if you notice the application is not populating similar title suggestions.
